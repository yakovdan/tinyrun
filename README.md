# tinyrun
A simple python VM experiment. 
At present, there are two test programs available:

1. A function definition and call test case
2. Recurrsion test case using fibonacci

Limitations: no generators, no closures. no support for blocks yet
Only a small, but growing  subset of opcodes is implemented right now. 

test programs are hardcoded in separate files
